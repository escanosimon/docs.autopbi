# What is AutoPBI?

AutoPBI is a powerful desktop application that automates bulk tasks that you cannot perform in Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service. It was developed by Simon Esca√±o to streamline Power BI workflows and save time for data professionals.

## Key Capabilities

AutoPBI enables you to perform the following bulk operations that are not available in the standard Power BI tools:

- **Download in bulk** - Download multiple reports and their linked datasets as .pbix files
- **Publish in bulk** - Import and publish multiple .pbix files to different workspaces
- **Delete in bulk** - Remove multiple reports and their linked datasets from workspaces
- **Clone in bulk** - Duplicate reports across different workspaces
- **Scan in bulk** - Check for errors in linked datasets across multiple reports
- **Refresh in bulk** - Trigger manual refreshes for multiple datasets
- **Takeover in bulk** - Transfer ownership of datasets and data sources

## Why Use AutoPBI?

Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service are excellent tools for individual report creation and management, but they lack efficient bulk operations. AutoPBI fills this gap by providing:

- **Time savings** - Perform operations on multiple reports simultaneously
- **Consistency** - Apply the same operation across multiple workspaces
- **Efficiency** - Reduce manual repetitive tasks
- **Error reduction** - Automated processes reduce human error

## Target Users

AutoPBI is designed for:
- Power BI administrators
- Data analysts working with multiple reports
- Organizations managing large Power BI deployments
- Anyone who needs to perform bulk operations on Power BI content
