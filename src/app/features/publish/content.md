## Important Notes

- **Separate Reports**: Each .pbix file becomes a separate report in the target workspace

- **Permissions**: Ensure you have publish permissions in the target workspaces
- **File Size**: Large .pbix files may take longer to publish

## Troubleshooting

**Publish Fails**
- Check your permissions in the target workspace
- Ensure the .pbix files are valid and not corrupted
- Verify your internet connection is stable

**Workspace Not Available**
- Make sure you have access to the workspace
- Check if the workspace exists and is active

**File Import Issues**
- Ensure the files are valid .pbix format
- Check if the files are not locked or in use by another application
